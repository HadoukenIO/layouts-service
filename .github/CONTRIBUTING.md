# Contributions
# Contributing to HadoukenIO

# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
A CLA is a document that specifies how a project is allowed to use your
contribution; they are commonly used in many open source projects.

**_All_ contributions to _all_ projects hosted by [FINOS](https://www.finos.org/)
must be made with a
[Foundation CLA](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/83034172/Contribute)
in place, and there are [additional legal requirements](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Legal+Requirements)
that must also be met.**

Commits and pull requests to FINOS repositories such as HadoukenIO/layouts-service will only be accepted from those contributors with an active, executed Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) with FINOS OR who are covered under an existing and active Corporate Contribution License Agreement (CCLA) executed with FINOS. Commits from individuals not covered under an ICLA or CCLA will be flagged and blocked by the FINOS ["CLA Bot" tool](https://github.com/finos/cla-bot). Please note that some CCLAs require individuals/employees to be explicitly named on the CCLA.

As a result, PRs submitted to the HadoukenIO/layouts-service project cannot be accepted until you have a CLA in place with the Foundation.
