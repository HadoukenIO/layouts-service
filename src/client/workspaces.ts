 * Takes a Workspace object created by the {@link generate} function and restores the state of the desktop at the time it was generated
 *

 *
 * If an application or child window is not up and running, the layouts service will create a transparent placeholder window for it, as an
 * indication to the user that a window is in the process of loading. The placeholder window will listen for its corresponding window to
 * come up, and subsequently close itself.
 *
 * Once all placeholder windows are up, the layouts service will ungroup and un-tab any windows participating in restoration. This is done to
 * prevent a window from dragging its group around the desktop, into a location that wasn't originally intended. Restore does not touch
 * any windows that were not declared in the Workspace object.
 *
 * Once all windows are ungrouped, the layouts service will then tab together all windows involved in a tabgroup. Placeholder windows are
 * included in this tabbing step. Once a placeholder window's corresponding restored window comes up, that restored window takes
 * the place of the placeholder window in the tabset.
 *
 * Once all groups have been set up, the layouts service will then begin opening and positioning the applications and windows.
 *
 * If an application is up and running, the layouts service will position it in its proper place. If the application isn't running,
 * the layouts service will attempt to launch it after it has been launched. It is then positioned.
 *
 * If the application has registered {@link setGenerateHandler|generate} and {@link setRestoreHandler|restore} callbacks, and called
 * the {@link ready} function, the layouts service will send it its Workspace data. If an application has saved its child windows,
 * it *MUST* create those child windows with the same names defined in its Workspace. If it does not do so, {@link restore} will fail.
 *
 * Once all applications and child windows have been spun up and positioned, and all placeholder windows have been closed, the layouts
 * service will then group all windows that were formerly snapped together.
 *
 * Finally, the layouts service will send a 'workspace-restored' event to all windows, and complete restoration.
