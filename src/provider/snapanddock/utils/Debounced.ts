 * Util for de-bouncing calls to a function. The function will be wrapped within this object, which bundles the

 *
 * This util is intended for calling a function after a short delay, whilst also ensuring that the function is called
 * only once within that period. Any attempt to call the function within the timeout period will reset the timer.
 *
 * The callback function and scope are set at construction, with any function arguments being passed at the time the
 * timeout is (re-)started.
